> Fetch-friendly Scratch API (wip)

If you did not know before, the Scratch API does not allow fetching via Javascript due to its strict CORS policy. Although, there's obviously no reason to deny this since it stops a large variety of people from using the Scratch API, especially in static websites.

While this may sound cool and all, it still has its fair share of problems. Every so then, the app will not return any response and just a 404. But this is mostly if you are spamming requests.
